2. To use the existing calibration, double-click on the project folder located: "D:\DepthKit" named "Volcap_4020".
	>If you encounter any issues with the camera calibration, please refer to the [Calibration](https://docs.depthkit.tv/docs/calibration) documentation  on recalibrating the cameras. If necessary, please create a new project for this purpose.

	>(Please ensure that the subject avoids wearing black/ white/ glasses/ ripped clothes for the best texture output.)
